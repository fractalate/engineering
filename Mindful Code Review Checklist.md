# Mindful Code Review Checklist

*January 2024, Revision 0 (Pre-release)*

This questionnaire is designed to be used when you are reviewing code. You might use this when reviewing an entire project you're not familiar with or while evaluating a pull request for your own project on GitHub.

## Orient Yourself

Before considering the code deeply, gain an understanding of the context in which the software is used and developed.

* What kind of computer systems run the software?
* What languages and tools are used to build the software?
* What libraries does the software use?
* What ecosystems does this software exist within?
* What relevant direction is outlined for the software?
* Who are the intended users of the software?

## More Stuff

* What are the desired outcomes of the code?
* Does the code produce the desired outcomes?
* What experiences are offered by the code?
* How are each of those experiences activated?
* Which code or systems does the code affect?
* Is the code clear?
* Does the code follow project, team, or ecosystem conventions?
* Is the relevant documentation updated?
* Are tests passing?
* Are relevant tests added or updated?
